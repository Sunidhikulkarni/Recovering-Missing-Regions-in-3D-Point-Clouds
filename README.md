# Recovering-Missing-Regions-in-3D-Point-Clouds
The point cloud data suffer from holes and missing information in the point cloud which
gives rise to different problems while representing the point cloud in various applications
This hinders tasks such as classification and segmentation
This problem is solved by using hole filling or shape completion mechanisms.
mportance of digitization of heritage data
Due to both man-made and natural causes, heritage sites are being subject to immense
pressure
Urbanization and development activities of the modern-day world threats
Can eliminate the rich legacy inherited from past generations
There is need to preserve the remains of our rich cultural heritage
In this direction of 3d reconstruction, shape completion is the problem that is being
addressed in this project
